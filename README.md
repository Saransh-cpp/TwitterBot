# TwitterBot

A python twitter bot hosted at pythonanywhere.com that automatically replies with a quote if you mention me and tweet 'Hello Friend' and tweets different battery degradation plots taken from [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM). I might move it to other cloud hosting services like heroku soon.
